<p>At 17, Carl Williams started his 60-year prison sentence and after serving 27 years, Williams was proven innocent. “I’ve spent more of my life in prison than I have in society,” said Williams. </p>
<p>
    After his experiences, Williams is now an activist for prison abolition and works closely with incarcerated youth. William believes that when holding youth accountable for the harm they may cause, prison is not the answer.  
</p>

<p>
    “No one is excusing the crime,” said Williams, “but when you sentence a youth to any amount of time, that’s extreme and impacts that person for the rest of their lives.”  
</p>

<p>
    William’s is one of many that have been incarcerated in the state of Illinois as a youth and many organizations such as the Final 5 Campaign are working to close these facilities.  
</p>

<p>
    As of today, the state has five youth prisons or Illinois Youth Facilities that combined have an average daily population of less than 500 according to the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice. 
</p>

<p>
    Since the F5C started in August of 2020, the group has used virtual meeting spaces to organize for the closing of these prisons according to Olivia Blocker, F5C’s Campaign Coordinator.  
</p>

<p>
    Since COVID-19 has made in-person meetings not an option, the organization has gone “fully virtual” according to Blocker. Within meetings the organization hopes to give people a “virtual space to give people tips and language on how to talk to friends and family and their communities about these ideas,” said Blocker.   
</p>
<p>
    The campaign’s youth cohort, a small group of young people ages 16-24 who have gone to prison in Illinois, plays a major role in these meetings as well. 
	“Since young people aren’t really included in these conversations often, the main goal of this campaign is to uplift their ideas,” said Blocker.   
</p>
<p>
    This group of young people also had a voice during the creation of this campaign. According to the campaign’s website, “The cohort had the opportunity to work on multiple projects, including curriculum development, communications, and social media strategy, policy, and report writing.” 	
  
</p>
<p>
    Along with a variety of perspectives within the F5C, they also collaborate with other like-minded organizations focused on prison abolition, such as the Liberation Library which provides incarcerated young people with books of their choice.   
</p>

<p>
    Alyssa Beer, member of the Liberation Library’s Steering Committee said,” Liberation Library has been working with F5C since the campaign started.” Together the organizations have shared resources and supported each other's work. “It’s cool when we get to do that, said Beer.   
</p>
	


<p>
    As grassroots campaigns that are facing a historically secretive and powerful institution, Beer stated that sharing resources and knowledge is important. “Prisons by design, keep information inside and keep the public out, and together we can pool our knowledge,” said Beer.   
</p>
	
<p>
 As the F5C grows it supports and continues its fight, a large part of the curriculum is discussing and developing alternatives to youth prisons. </p>

<p> These alternatives usually center around reallocation of tax funds into communities and a less extreme approach to reprimanding the wrongs done by children. </p>
	
<p>
    “Young people need space to make mistakes and grow without the threat of carceral violence, and resources we invest in should be grounded in that understanding,” said the F5C in a blog post.
